Last Man Standing Telegram Bot

A Telegram bot for running Last Man Standing football competitions with group isolation.
Each Telegram group runs its own independent competition with:
- Group-specific survivors and eliminations
- Independent winner tracking and leaderboards  
- Isolated pick history and team blocking
- Automatic competition resets per group
- Savage roasting messages for eliminations and deadline misses
